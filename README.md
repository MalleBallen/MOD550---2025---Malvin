A repository in the course MOD550 - Fundaments of Machine Learning for and with Engineering Applications. 

*Machine learning has recently emerged as one of the most promising resources for engineers, offering a set of powerful approaches to tackle complex engineering challenges. By employing various statistical techniques in learning algorithms, machine learning enables the development of predictive models, optimization strategies, and decision support systems that can enhance the design, analysis, and control of engineered systems. This technology empowers engineers to extract meaningful insights from vast datasets, automate repetitive tasks, and improve the efficiency, reliability, and performance of engineering processes. Its applications span diverse domains, from mechanical and chemical engineering to geo, material science, etc. making machine learning an indispensable resource for modern computational engineers for physics based and data-driven solutions to real-world problems.*  

 

*Most undergraduates in engineering and science fields have little exposure to data methods, while most computer scientists and statisticians have little exposure to dynamical system control. Our goal is to provide an entry point and interface for both these groups of students.*  

****About me****  
I'm a 25 year old from Arendal, currently living in Stavanger with my girlfriend. Despite having a full-time job as a purchaser in Aibel, I love a good challenge. That's why I'm doing my best to complete the master course on UiS in computational engineering on the alongside work. It might be a bit over my head, but at least I will give it my best shot :D  
*****Warning! Vital info ahead!*****  
I have a 12 week old golden retriever (As of middle of september). This might or might not save lives. üê∂

**Task 1**  

1: make a histogram from a 2d random distribution  
2: make a 2d heat map from a 2d random distribution  
3: make a histogram for the source data you selected  
4: convert the histogram into a discrete PMF  
5: calculate the cumulative for each feature
