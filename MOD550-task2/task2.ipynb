If you are lost, you can find practical info here on how to use already made libraries: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/regularization-in-machine-learning/Lenker til en ekstern side.  The issue here will be data structure: np.array vs list of list vs pandas DataFrames.  \n",

(b) Discuss how you can use the validation data for the different cases. (c) Discuss the different outcome from the different models when using the full dataset to train and when you use a different ML approach. (d) Discuss the outcomes you get for K-means and GMM. (e) Discuss how you can integrate supervised and unsupervised methods for your case.  "
